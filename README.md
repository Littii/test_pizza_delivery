# test_pizza_delivery
Page object here was used, as for small project, so there are only one class with locators. If split this file for few different pages, it's possible to move there all "FindBy" methods from page classes.
This tests was created for fake site, made up by myself, so in real project it may be needed to add more 'wait of element' methods or even just waits, for some rare cases.
